\chapter*{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{fmbm}{Preface}

There is a magical moment when a programmer presses the ``run'' button
and the software begins to execute. Somehow a program written in a
high-level language is running on a computer that is only capable of
shuffling bits. Here we reveal the wizardry that makes that moment
possible. Beginning with the groundbreaking work of Backus and
colleagues in the 1950s, computer scientists discovered techniques for
constructing programs, called \emph{compilers}, that automatically
translate high-level programs into machine code.

We take you on a journey by constructing your own compiler for a small
but powerful language. Along the way we explain the essential
concepts, algorithms, and data structures that underlie compilers. We
develop your understanding of how programs are mapped onto computer
hardware, which is helpful when reasoning about properties at the
junction between hardware and software such as execution time,
software errors, and security vulnerabilities.  For those interested
in pursuing compiler construction, our goal is to provide a
stepping-stone to advanced topics such as just-in-time compilation,
program analysis, and program optimization.  For those interested in
designing and implementing programming languages, we connect
language design choices to their impact on the compiler and the generated
code.

A compiler is typically organized as a sequence of stages that
progressively translates a program to code that runs on hardware. We
take this approach to the extreme by partitioning our compiler into a
large number of \emph{nanopasses}, each of which performs a single
task. This allows us to test the output of each pass in isolation, and
furthermore, allows us to focus our attention making the compiler far
easier to understand.

%% [TODO: easier to understand/debug for those maintaining the compiler,
%%   proving correctness]

The most familiar approach to describing compilers is with one pass
per chapter.  The problem with that is it obfuscates how language
features motivate design choices in a compiler. We take an
\emph{incremental} approach in which we build a complete compiler in
each chapter, starting with arithmetic and variables and add new
features in subsequent chapters.

Our choice of language features is designed to elicit the fundamental
concepts and algorithms used in compilers.
\begin{itemize}
\item We begin with integer arithmetic and local variables in
  Chapters~\ref{ch:trees-recur} and \ref{ch:Rvar}, where we introduce
  the fundamental tools of compiler construction: \emph{abstract
    syntax trees} and \emph{recursive functions}. 
\item In Chapter~\ref{ch:register-allocation-Rvar} we apply
  \emph{graph coloring} to assign variables to machine registers.
\item Chapter~\ref{ch:Rif} adds \code{if} expressions, which motivates
  an elegant recursive algorithm for mapping expressions to
  \emph{control-flow graphs}.
\item Chapter~\ref{ch:Rvec} adds heap-allocated tuples, motivating
  \emph{garbage collection}.
\item Chapter~\ref{ch:Rfun} adds functions that are first-class values
  but lack lexical scoping, similar to the C programming
  language~\citep{Kernighan:1988nx} except that we generate efficient
  tail calls. The reader learns about the procedure call stack,
  \emph{calling conventions}, and their interaction with register
  allocation and garbage collection.
\item Chapter~\ref{ch:Rlam} adds anonymous functions with lexical
  scoping, i.e., \emph{lambda abstraction}. The reader learns about
  \emph{closure conversion}, in which lambdas are translated into a
  combination of functions and tuples.
\item Chapter~\ref{ch:Rdyn} adds \emph{dynamic typing}. Prior to this
  point the input languages are statically typed.  The reader extends
  the statically typed language with an \code{Any} type which serves
  as a target for compiling the dynamically typed language.
\item Chapter~\ref{ch:Rwhile} fleshes out support for imperative
  programming languages with the addition of loops and mutable
  variables. These additions elicit the need for \emph{dataflow
    analysis} in the register allocator.
\item Chapter~\ref{ch:Rgrad} uses the \code{Any} type of
  Chapter~\ref{ch:Rdyn} to implement a \emph{gradually typed language}
  in which different regions of a program may be static or dynamically
  typed. The reader implements runtime support for \emph{proxies} that
  allow values to safely move between regions.
\item Chapter~\ref{ch:Rpoly} adds \emph{generics} with autoboxing,
  leveraging the \code{Any} type and type casts developed in Chapters
  \ref{ch:Rdyn} and \ref{ch:Rgrad}.
\end{itemize}
There are many language features that we do not include. Our choices
weigh the incidental complexity of a feature against the fundamental
concepts that it exposes. For example, we include tuples and not
records because they both elicit the study of heap allocation and
garbage collection but records come with more incidental complexity.

Since 2016 this book has served as the textbook for the compiler
course at Indiana University, a 16-week course for upper-level
undergraduates and first-year graduate students.
%
Prior to this course, students learn to program in both imperative and
functional languages, study data structures and algorithms, and take
discrete mathematics.
%
At the beginning of the course, students form groups of 2-4 people.
The groups complete one chapter every two weeks, starting with
Chapter~\ref{ch:Rvar} and finishing with Chapter~\ref{ch:Rdyn}. Many
chapters include a challenge problem that we assign to the graduate
students. The last two weeks of the course involve a final project in
which students design and implement a compiler extension of their
choosing.  Chapters~\ref{ch:Rwhile}, \ref{ch:Rgrad}, and
\ref{ch:Rpoly} can be used in support of these projects or they can
replace some of the earlier chapters. For example, a course with an
emphasis on statically-typed imperative languages would skip
Chapter~\ref{ch:Rdyn} in favor of
Chapter~\ref{ch:Rwhile}. Figure~\ref{fig:chapter-dependences} depicts
the dependencies between chapters.

This book has also been used in compiler courses at California
Polytechnic State University, Roseâ€“Hulman Institute of Technology, and
University of Massachusetts Lowell.

We use the \href{https://racket-lang.org/}{Racket} language both for
the implementation of the compiler and for the input language, so the
reader should be proficient with Racket or Scheme. There are many
excellent resources for learning Scheme and
Racket~\citep{Dybvig:1987aa,Abelson:1996uq,Friedman:1996aa,Felleisen:2001aa,Felleisen:2013aa,Flatt:2014aa}. The
support code for this book is in the \code{github} repository at the
following URL:
\begin{center}\small
  \url{https://github.com/IUCompilerCourse/public-student-support-code}
\end{center}

The compiler targets x86 assembly language~\citep{Intel:2015aa}, so it
is helpful but not necessary for the reader to have taken a computer
systems course~\citep{Bryant:2010aa}. This book introduces the parts
of x86-64 assembly language that are needed.
%
We follow the System V calling
conventions~\citep{Bryant:2005aa,Matz:2013aa}, so the assembly code
that we generate works with the runtime system (written in C) when it
is compiled using the GNU C compiler (\code{gcc}) on Linux and MacOS
operating systems.
%
On the Windows operating system, \code{gcc} uses the Microsoft x64
calling convention~\citep{Microsoft:2018aa,Microsoft:2020aa}. So the
assembly code that we generate does \emph{not} work with the runtime
system on Windows. One workaround is to use a virtual machine with
Linux as the guest operating system.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

The tradition of compiler construction at Indiana University goes back
to research and courses on programming languages by Daniel Friedman in
the 1970's and 1980's.  One of his students, Kent Dybvig, implemented
Chez Scheme~\citep{Dybvig:2006aa}, a production-quality, efficient
compiler for Scheme.  Throughout the 1990's and 2000's, Dybvig taught
the compiler course and continued the development of Chez Scheme.
%
The compiler course evolved to incorporate novel pedagogical ideas
while also including elements of efficient real-world compilers.  One
of Friedman's ideas was to split the compiler into many small
passes. Another idea, called ``the game'', was to test the code
generated by each pass on interpreters.

Dybvig, with help from his students Dipanwita Sarkar and Andrew Keep,
developed infrastructure to support this approach and evolved the
course to use even smaller
nanopasses~\citep{Sarkar:2004fk,Keep:2012aa}.  Many of the compiler
design decisions in this book are inspired by the assignment
descriptions of \citet{Dybvig:2010aa}. In the mid 2000's a student of
Dybvig's named Abdulaziz Ghuloum observed that the front-to-back
organization of the course made it difficult for students to
understand the rationale for the compiler design. Ghuloum proposed the
incremental approach~\citep{Ghuloum:2006bh}.

We thank the many graduate students who served as teaching assistants
for the compiler course at IU. In particular, we thank Andre
Kuhlenschmidt for his work on the garbage collector, Michael Vollmer
for his work on efficient tail calls, and Michael Vitousek for his
help running the first offering of the incremental compiler course at
IU.

We thank Bor-Yuh Chang, John Clements, Jay McCarthy, Joseph Near, Nate
Nystrom, and Michael Wollowski for teaching courses based on early
drafts of this book.

We thank Ronald Garcia for being Jeremy's partner when they took the
compiler course in the early 2000's and especially for finding the bug
that sent the garbage collector on a wild goose chase!

%% The Helpmate service robot transports food and medication throughout hospitals
%% by tracking the position of ceiling lights, which are manually specified to
%% the robot beforehand. Several companies have developed autonomous
%% cleaning robots, mainly for large buildings. 

%% This book focuses on the technology of mobility: how can a mobile robot move
%% unsupervised through real-world environments to fulfill its tasks? The first
%% challenge is locomotion itself. How should a mobile robot move, and what is it
%% about a particular locomotion mechanism that makes it superior to alternative
%% locomotion mechanisms?


%% \subsection{Key Issues for Locomotion}
%% Locomotion is the complement of manipulation. In manipulation, the robot arm
%% is fixed but moves objects in the workspace by imparting force to them. In
%% locomotion, the environment is fixed and the robot moves by imparting force to
%% the environment. In both cases, the scientific basis is the study of actuators that
%% generate interaction forces, and mechinisms that implement disired kinematic
%% and dynamic properties. Locomotion and manipulation thus share the same core
%% issues of stability, contact characteristics, and environmental type:

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item
%% stability
%% \item
%% number and geometry of contact points
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item
%% center of gravity
%% \item
%% static/dynamic stability
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item
%% inclination of terrain
%% \item
%% characteristics of contact
%% \end{itemize}
%% \item
%% contact point/path size and shape
%% \item
%% angle of contact
%% \end{itemize}
%% \item
%% friction
%% \item
%% type of environment
%% \item
%% structure
%% medium (e.g. water, air. soft or hard ground).
%% \end{itemize}
%% For example, Plustech's walking robot provides automatic leg coordination while
%% the human operator chooses an overall direction of travel. Figure
%% 1.5 depicts an underwater vehicle that controls six propellers to autonomously
%% transports food and medication throughout hospitals by tracking the position
%% of ceiling lights, which are manually specified to the robot
%% beforehand.  Several companies have developed autonomous robots.

%% The six different events are
%% \begin{enumerate}[2.]
%% \item
%% lift right leg
%% \item
%% left let leg
%% \begin{enumerate}[ii.]
%% \item
%% release right leg
%% \item
%% release left leg
%% \begin{enumerate}[(ii)]
%% \item
%% lift both legs together
%% \item
%% release both legs together
%% \end{enumerate}
%% \end{enumerate}
%% \end{enumerate}
%% Of course, this quickly grows quite large. For example, a robot with six legs
%% has far more gaits theoretically.

%% \section{Sample Equations}
%% \begin{equation}
%% \label{eq:rhoCHT}
%% \rho^{\pi}= \frac{RI + \mathbb{E}_{\pi([L,\tau_L]|\textrm{post})}
%% \left[C_L(\taupav+\tau_L) \right]   +
%% \displaystyle{\int_{0}^{P}}{dw~ \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{w_L}}}
%% \Biggl[\/\sum_{n_{L|[\textrm{pre},w]}}C_L(\tau_L)
%% \Biggr]            }      {P +
%% \mathbb{E}_{\pi([L,\tau_L] |\textrm{post})}[\tau_{L}] +\taupav +
%% \displaystyle{ \int_{0}^{P}}{dw~ \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{w_L}}}   
%% \Biggl[\sum_{n_{L|[\textrm{pre},w]}}\tau_L\Biggr]  
%% }
%% \end{equation}
%% As long as
%% $RI - K_LP > 
%% \frac{1}{\beta}$
%% \begin{equation}
%% \left.\begin{array}{lrcl}
%% &\rho^{\pi} &=&  \displaystyle\frac{\beta ( RI + K_L \taupav )-1} {\beta
%% (P+\taupav )}    \\[12pt]
%% \hbox{and}\hbox to .25in{\hfill}&\mathbb{E}[\tau_L | \text{post}]
%% &=&\displaystyle \frac{P+\taupav}{\beta ( RI -
%% K_LP)-1}  
%% \label{eq:analytical_linear}
%% \end{array}\right\}
%% \end{equation} 


%% \subsection{One Leg} 

%% The minimum number of legs a legged robot can have is, of
%% course, one. Minimizing the number of legs is beneficial for several reasons.
%% Body mass is particularly important to walking machines, and the single leg
%% minimizes cumulative leg mass.

%% Omnidirectional locomotion with three spherical wheels The omnidirectional
%% robot depicted in figure 2.23 is based on three spherical wheels, each actuated
%% by one motor. In theis design, the sperical wheels are suspended by three contact
%% points, two given by spherical bearings and one by a wheel connected to
%% the motor axle. This concept provides excellent maneuverability and is simple
%% in design. However, it is limited to flat surfaces and small loads, and it is quite
%% difficult to find round wheels with high friction coefficients.

%% \chapter{Gravitational Waves}

%% \section{Mass in Spacetime}
%% As objects with
%% mass move around in spacetime,\endnote{Test for endnote for endnote for endnote for endnote for endnote for endnote for endnote for endnote for endnote for endnote} the curvature changes to reflect the
%% changed locations of those objects. In certain circumstances,
%% accelerating objects generate changes in this curvature, which
%% propagate outwards at the speed of light in a wave-like manner. These
%% propagating phenomena are known as gravitational waves.\endnote{Prof. Gabriela Gonz\'alez, from Louisiana State University,
%% said: ``We have discovered gravitational waves from the merger of black
%% holes. It's been a very long road, but this is just the beginning.
%% }

%% \subsection{Gauss's Law for Gravity}
%% In physics, \sfbfit{Gauss's law for gravity}, also known
%% as \sfbfit{Gauss's flux
%% theorem for}\break \sfbfit{gravity}, is a law of physics that is essentially
%% equivalent to Newton's law of universal gravitation. It is named after
%% Carl Friedrich Gauss.\index{authors}{Gauss, Carl Friedrich}

%% The gravitational field \boldmath$g$\unboldmath (also called gravitational acceleration) is
%% a vector field---a vector at each point of space (and time). It is
%% defined so that the gravitational force experienced by a particle is
%% equal to the mass of the particle multiplied by the gravitational
%% field at that point.

%% Gravitational flux is a surface integral of the gravitational field
%% over a closed surface, analogous to how magnetic flux is a surface
%% integral of the magnetic field.

%% As a result of the divergence theorem, a host of physical laws can be
%% written in both a differential form (where one quantity is the
%% divergence of another) and an integral form (where the flux of one
%% quantity through a closed surface is equal to another quantity).
%% Three examples are Gauss's law (in electrostatics), Gauss's law for
%% magnetism, and Gauss's law for gravity.     
%% Gauss's law for gravity states:
%% \begin{theorem}
%%     The gravitational flux through any closed surface is proportional
%%     to the enclosed mass.  \end{theorem}
%% \begin{proof}
%% The integral form of Gauss's law is:
%% \[ \oiint
%% \mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {A}  = 
%% {\frac {Q}{\varepsilon _{0}}}  \]
%% for any closed surface $S$ containing charge $Q$. By the divergence
%% theorem, this equation is equivalent to:
%% \[
%% \iiint\limits_{V}
%%  \boldnabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \,\, \mathrm{d}   V={\frac
%% {Q}{\varepsilon _{0}}}
%% \]
%% for any volume $V$ containing charge $Q$. By the relation between charge
%% and charge density, this equation is equivalent to:
%% \[\iiint\limits_{V} \boldnabla \cdot\mathbf{E}\,\,\mathrm{d} V = 
%% \iiint
%% \limits _{V}{\frac {\rho }{\varepsilon _{0}}}\ \mathrm {d} V\]
%% for any volume $V$. In order for this equation to be simultaneously
%% true for every possible volume $V$,  
%% it is necessary (and sufficient) for the integrands to be equal
%% everywhere.  Therefore, this equation is equivalent to:
%% \[    \boldnabla \cdot\mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho }{\varepsilon _{0}}. \]
%% Thus the integral and differential forms are equivalent.
%% \end{proof}


%% \subsection{Gravitational Waves}

%% Gravitational waves are `ripples' in the fabric of space-time caused
%% by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe.
%% Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916
%% in his general theory of relativity. Einstein's mathematics showed
%% that massive accelerating objects (such as neutron stars or black
%% holes orbiting each other) would disrupt space-time in such a way that

%% \noindent The discovery is a great triumph for three physicists---Kip Thorne of

%% \begin{extract}
%% Gravitational waves are not sound waves, and the
%% general public easily could have been led to that conclusion. Sound
%% waves travel only through a medium such as air; ripples in spacetime
%% donâ€™t need any medium to support them. Sound waves propagate at the
%% speed of sound; gravitational waves move at the speed of light. Even
%% someone with superhuman hearing could never listen in on a black hole
%% collision.

%% So why the connection between sound and gravitational waves? 
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item LIGO detects gravitational waves with frequencies
%% between several hertz and several kilohertz, the sweet spot for human
%% hearing. 
%% \item When two stellar-mass black holes collide, they happen to
%% jiggle spacetime at the same frequency as that of pressure waves in
%% the air that our ears pick up as sound.     
%% \end{itemize}
%% The LIGO discovery proves that black hole binaries exist, and that
%% those binaries can merge within the age of the universe.
%% \end{extract}

%% While the origins of gravitational waves
%% can be extremely violent, by the time the waves reach the Earth they
%% are millions of times smaller and less disruptive. In fact, by the
%% time gravitational waves from the first detection reached LIGO, the
%% amount of space-time wobbling they generated was thousands of times
%% smaller than the nucleus of an atom! Such inconceivably small
%% measurements are what LIGO was designed to make.


%% \begin{description}
%% \item[Wave passes]
%% As a gravitational wave passes an observer, that observer will find
%% spacetime distorted by the effects of strain. 

%% \item[Distances]
%% Distances between
%% objects increase and decrease rhythmically as the wave passes, at a
%% frequency corresponding to that of the wave. 
%% \end{description}
%% This occurs despite such
%% free objects never being subjected to an unbalanced force. The
%% magnitude of this effect decreases proportional to the inverse
%% distance from the source.

%% Such systems cannot be observed with more
%% traditional means such as optical telescopes or radio telescopes, and
%% so gravitational-wave astronomy gives new insights into the working of
%% the Universe. In particular, gravitational waves could be of interest
%% to cosmologists as they offer a possible way of observing the very
%% early Universe. This is not possible with conventional astronomy,
%% since before recombination the Universe was opaque to electromagnetic
%% radiation.

%% Precise measurements of gravitational waves will also
%% allow scientists to more thoroughly test the general theory of
%% relativity.

%% \begin{boxedtext}{Frank Wilczek on Einstein and Gravitation}
%% Einstein's general relativity, as a theory of gravitation, is so tight
%% conceptually that it allows only two free parameters: Newtonâ€™s
%% constant and the cosmological term. It has passed every test that
%% physicists and astronomers have devised. Yet there are reasons to
%% remain dissatisfied.

%% \section{First}
%% First, the strength of gravity is grossly disproportionate to the
%% strength of other forces. If we believe in the unity of natureâ€™s
%% operating system, how can that be? 

%% \subsection{Second}
%% Second, the measured value of the
%% mass density of space devoid of matter---the cosmological term, often
%% called dark energy---is incommensurate with reasonable expectations. Why
%% is it much smaller than theory suggests, yet not zero? 

%% \subsubsection{Third}
%% Third, the
%% equations that follow from straightforward quantization of general
%% relativity break down in extreme conditions. What are the
%% consequences? Those issues are important agenda items for the next 100
%% years of physics. In the boxes, I've indicated a promising way to
%% approach the question of the weakness of gravity. Here I'll offer a
%% few comments on the other issues.


%% \begin{extract}
%% Theorists have estimated several contributions to the cosmological
%% term-positive and negative---whose individual absolute values far exceed
%% the observed total value. Thus the termâ€™s observed smallness indicates
%% delicate cancellations that our core theories do not explain. Perhaps,
%% as suggested by Steven Weinberg, the explanation is anthropic. Too
%% large a cosmological term would lead the universe to expand so rapidly
%% that formation of structure in the universe would be inhibited.
%% Neither galaxies nor stars nor planets would form, and thus observers
%% could not emerge. Is that anthropic argument the best physics can
%% do---is resistance futile? Or is some deeper principle at work?
%% \end{extract}

%% \section*{Conceptual difficulty}
%% The conceptual difficulty of reconciling our theory of gravity,
%% general relativity, with the principles of quantum mechanics has been
%% the subject of much hyperbole. I think it is important, therefore,
%% first to bring it down to earth.   

%% (Frank Wilczek, Physics Today, April 2016,

%% \index{authors}{Wilczek, Frank}

%% In principle, gravitational waves could exist at any frequency.
%% However, very low frequency waves would be impossible to detect and
%% there is no credible source for detectable waves of very high
%% frequency. Stephen Hawking and Werner Israel list different frequency
%% bands for gravitational waves that could plausibly be detected,
%% ranging from 10--7 Hz up to 1011 Hz. 

%% In theory, the loss of energy through gravitational radiation could
%% eventually drop the Earth into the Sun. However, the total energy of
%% the Earth orbiting the Sun (kinetic energy + gravitational potential
%% energy) is about 1.14$\times$1036 joules of which only 200 joules per second
%% is lost through gravitational radiation, leading to a decay in the
%% orbit by about $1\times10$--15 meters per day or roughly the diameter of a
%% proton. At this rate, it would take the Earth approximately $1\times 1013$
%% times more than the current age of the Universe to spiral onto the
%% Sun. This estimate overlooks the decrease in r over time, but the
%% majority of the time the bodies are far apart and only radiating
%% slowly, so the difference is unimportant in this example.

%% \section{The Canada France Hawaii Lensing Survey}

%% Did you know that less than 4\% of our Universe is made up of regular
%% matter - the type that makes up the Earth, the planets and the stars?
%% The rest is 'dark' and invisible, but we know that it is there through
%% its effects on the regular matter that we can see. The gravity of Dark
%% Matter causes galaxies to clump together in a giant cosmic web, and
%% Dark Energy is pushing space itself apart at an accelerated rate. With
%% some of the world's best telescopes we can directly witness the
%% ongoing battle between these two strange entities.

%% \subsection{CFHTL}
%% The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey uses an innovative
%% technique called gravitational lensing to observe the invisible dark
%% matter in our Universe. Using data accumulated over five years by the
%% CFHT Legacy Survey, the CFHTLenS team have analysed the images of over
%% 10 million galaxies. The light emitted by these galaxies has taken
%% nearly half the age of the Universe to reach us and has been bent and
%% distorted by the massive clumps of dark matter it has passed by.
%% Exploiting this fact that `mass bends light', as predicted by
%% Einstein, we have privileged access to the mysterious components of
%% the Universe that cannot otherwise be observed.

%% \section{Dark Matter and Black Holes}
%% We know that dark matter exists because of our mathematical graphs of
%% how fast the material in a galaxy is rotating in relation to the
%% center of the galaxy (where most of the galactic material is located).
%% And as a result of these graphs, we know that dark matter surrounds
%% galaxies. In the end, the farther out you go, the more mass
%% grows\ldots and
%% it grows by a lot. So in short, we know that dark matter isnâ€™t just
%% some black hole that exists out in the middle of intergalactic space
%% based on the way that galaxies rotate and evolve over time.

%%  As Emma Grocutt, from the
%% CFHTL Survey notes:\index{authors}{Grocutt, Emma}

%% \begin{extract}
%% The most interesting thing about dark matter is not simply that we
%% can't see it, it's that we know dark matter is not made of the same
%% stuff as normal baryonic matter. This is actually why we can't see
%% it---baryons interact with each other through gravity, nuclear forces and
%% the electrostatic force. These interactions are what allow baryonic
%% matter (such as stars) to emit light, and what prevent you from
%% putting your hand through a table---the particles of your hand are
%% electrostatically repelled from the particles in the table. Dark
%% matter, however, only interacts through gravity. This is why we see
%% its effects on the motions of galaxies and stars, but why we can't see
%% it directly; it does not emit or absorb light. Dark matter particles
%% can also pass through regular matter almost completely undetected
%% since they don't interact electrostatically, meaning we can't touch it
%% or sense it in any direct way.

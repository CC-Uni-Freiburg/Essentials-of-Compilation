abstract = {We study two partial type inference methods for a language combining subtyping and impredicative polymorphism. Both methods are local in the sense that missing annotations are recovered using only information from adjacent nodes in the syntax tree, without long-distance constraints such as unification variables. One method infers type arguments in polymorphic applications using a local constraint solver. The other infers annotations on bound variables in function abstractions by propagating type constraints downward from enclosing application nodes. We motivate our design choices by a statistical analysis of the uses of type inference in a sizable body of existing ML code.},

abstract = {Bidirectional typing combines two modes of typing: type checking, which checks that a program satisfies a known type, and type synthesis, which determines a type from the program. Using checking enables bidirectional typing to support features for which inference is undecidable; using synthesis enables bidirectional typing to avoid the large annotation burden of explicitly typed languages. In addition, bidirectional typing improves error locality. We highlight the design principles that underlie bidirectional type systems, survey the development of bidirectional typing from the prehistoric period before Pierce and Turner’s local type inference to the present day, and provide guidance for future investigations.},

The generated code is of very high quality and avoids most inefficiencies commonly associated with one-pass code generation. In particular, redundant conditional and unconditional branches are kept to a minimum. The scheme is general enough to compile the boolean expressions of a typical high-level language such as Pascal. It is presented in a format suited for syntax-directed translation and can be used with both top-down and bottom-up parsing.},

a few patches to Chez Scheme. DrRacket runs, the Racket distribution can build itself,

of the resulting implementation are good, although some work remains to improve end-to-end
performance. The least predictable part of our effort was how big the differences
between Racket and Chez Scheme would turn out to be and how we would manage those
differences. We expect Racket on Chez Scheme to become the main Racket implementation,
